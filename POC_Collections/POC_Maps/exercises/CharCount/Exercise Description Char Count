Exercise:
 - Create a method that counts the characters of a String and groups the count by character.
 - Example:
    Parameter: "Glass"
    Return(Map): {G = 1, L = 1, A = 1, S = 2}
    The returned Map must have the characters sorted in alphabetical order
    TipÂ´: Use the toCharArray() method from the String class to access the characters.
