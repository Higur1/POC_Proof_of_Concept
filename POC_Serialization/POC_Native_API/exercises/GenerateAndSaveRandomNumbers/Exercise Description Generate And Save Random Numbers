Exercise:
    Create a program that generates a random number(Double) and saves it to a file named numbers.out
    Every time the program runs, it should load the previously generated numbers, generate a new number, and save it to the file.
    In other words, it updates the file with the new number.
    Additionally, the program should display the full sequence of generated numbers on the screen each time it runs.
