Exercise:
    Create a method run() that takes 3 parameters:
        s: a String
        codeIfNull: a lambda
        codeIfNotNull: a lambda
    The run() method checks if the String s is null. If it is null, the code defined by codeIfNull is executed; if it is not null, the code defined by codeIfNotNull is executed.
    The lambda expression for codeIfNotNull must have access to the String object so it can be used if necessary.
