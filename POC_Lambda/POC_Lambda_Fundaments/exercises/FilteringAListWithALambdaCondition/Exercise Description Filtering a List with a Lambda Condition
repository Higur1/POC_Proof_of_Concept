Exercise:
    Create a method filter() that takes the following parameters:
        list: a list of integers
        condition: a condition expressed as a lambda expression
    When called, the filter() method should iterate over all elements in the collection and test the condition on each element.
    If the condition is true, the elements should remain in the collection; if false, the elements should be removed.
    The filter() method should return a new list with the filtered elements.
