Exercise:
    Write an algorithm using threads to approximate the value of π (pi) using the Gregory-Leibniz series:
        π/4 =   ∞
                ∑  (-1)n/2n+1
               n=0

    Use a thread to calculate a portion of the series. Each thread should store its result in a shared array (of type double)
    After all threads complete, sum all values in the array and multiply the result by 4 to get the approximation of
